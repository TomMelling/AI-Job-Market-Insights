# AI-Job-Market-Insights

What does the job market currently look like for jobs involving AI? What are the most useful tools to learn, and what salary could you expect to earn in the field? 

These queries aim to explore these questions and more using a suitable dataset. The data comes from Kaggle and consists of one table with 19 fields. Fields include salaries, skills required for the role, and years of experience required for the role. 

Examples of questions explored:
- Which required skills are associated with the highest salary jobs?
- What does the relationship between years experience and job salary look like?
- Do jobs with higher salaries tend to have longer application periods?

Some queries are further explored with Tableau visualizations (link to the Tableau Public is below.)
